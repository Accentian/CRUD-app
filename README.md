[![Blitz.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blitz-js/art/master/github-cover-photo.png)](https://blitzjs.com)

This is a [Blitz.js](https://github.com/blitz-js/blitz) app.

# ****CRUD App****

Request: Document your learning and teach others while you create a CRUD app using Blitz.js. There should be authentication. Also, have Blitz interface with MySQL and MongoDB. Create a GitHub repo: Where your Readme serves as a Tutorial.

CRUD is an acronym for four functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read, update and delete.

## System and Applications used
Project performed on:

-	Windows 11

-	Visual Code Studio

-	Windows PowerShell or Visual Code Studio Terminal

- Node.js

- Blitz.js


## Running the Blitz.js app

Run your app in the development mode. To do this, open a terminal of your choice. Ensure that you're located in the folder/directory that the app is in, then run the following command:

```
blitz dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Manually Creating this Blitz.js CRUD App

The following is a tutorial on how to develop the exact CRUD app displayed in this repo. You need to install Blitz.js and Node.js. I would recommend starting from here through this link: https://blitzjs.com/docs/get-started#set-up-your-computer. 

Check the version using Windows PowerShell or another terminal using the command `node -v`. 

- If not, download Node.js from their website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
